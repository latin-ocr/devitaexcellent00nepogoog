THEMISTOCLES. . 135

naebm. There was at Athens, near the marhot, a place feneed
in with reiis, into which any citizen might throw a stell or tile,
on which he had written the name of any great man whom he
wishedto have banrshed. At stated periods, these were oounted
, by the archons; and if they exceeded 6,000, the person whose
name was found on the majority was baniehed for ten
years. His property, however, was not confiscated; but was
preserved for him till his return. Some eay that the names
were written on abella,· and others, on tiles, or pieces of broken
earthen ware: and the latteris the more probable, as the word
suffragium, derived from eub andsrangere, meane a ambli frag·
ment ; and was probably adopted to signify a eote, because
votes were written on ench piebem-Argos: not the accusa·
tive plural, but the singular of the third declension, neuter ,
gender: Argos, gen. Argeos or Argis, as in line 13, below. Greek
