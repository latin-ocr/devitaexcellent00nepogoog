‘Coeranus Nnros is, more than any other Roman writer, suitedto
be put into the hands of boys, who have made sufficient pro ss to be
ableto read a Roman author in course. The simplicity an classical
character of his style ; the seperate lives, full of interest, and not long

· enough to weary; the extent of history, of which he gives a pleasing
